## Correlatives

Correlatives correspond to various pronouns and pronominal adverbs, formed by prefixing a simple adverbial root.  This feature is influenced by Esperanto.

Correlatives correspond to various types on pronouns and adjectives in other languages.

A correlative consist of a correlative prefix (specifier), and core correlative (identifier).

### Specifiers

prefix|name|usage
-|-|-
*kin-* | interrogative| Questions the property. Analogous to iterrogatory pronouns.
*ge-*  | proximal| Points to the property being meant, or last mentioned.
*koi-* | distal| Points to the property mentioned before.
*hai-* | existential| Indicates that an object of given identifier exists.
*xo-*  | universal | All identifiers.
*ro-*  | negatory | Postulates the absence of the identifier.
*zai-* | alternative | Indicates identifier, alternative to the default.
*go-*  | identical| Indicates identifier, identical to the default.
*bin-* | indifferential|Indicates absence of importance of identifier's specificity.

Specifiers combine with regular nouns, serving as demonstrative pronouns:
<br>*gemle* "this apple", *rofo* "no woman", *gohus* "same hands".

### Identifiers

core|name|usage
-|-|-
*-man* | tropical | Noun of tropical [gender](/Name_grammar/Noun_classes).
*-tu*  | objective| Noun of common [gender](/Name_grammar/Noun_classes).
*-va*  | temporal | Time, as occurence.
*-te*  | locative | Place, location.
*-hi*  | ajectival| Property of a name, adjectival pronoun.
*-mok* | adverbial| Property of an action, adverbial pronoun.
*-shi* | predicative| [Complete predicate](/Morphology/Predicative_identifier), has its own chapter.
*-jun* | quantitative| Number of objects, or amount of a substance.

English translations are approximate, for brevity's sake.  In particular, *jun*
also applies to countables, so *kinjun* means as well "how many", and so forth.

Standalone specifiers imply *tu*: *getu* → *ge*, *kin?* → *kintu?* etc.


*Man*, *tu* serve nominal functions and therefore combine with case
postositions, forming what may be construed as pronouns:




::: optional
It is permissible to spell these compounds with dash, with relevant change in pronunciation: _ge-mói_, _ro-mán_, _sui-shí_.

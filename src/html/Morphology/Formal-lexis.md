# Regulates stems

Regulated stems govern objects such names of the countries, currencies,
laguages, living things, airports and other things for which there exist a
codified nomenclature.  A code is transformed into a word, elongating the
abbreviation:

object | code | word
-|-|-
French language | FRA | *furaih*
Emirati (UAE) dirham | UAD | *unadah*

## Source lexical items

These objects are denoted by relatively short codes, widely accepted and
standardized.

They use idiomatic names in living languages, which presents certain
difficulties whenever a new entity appears, e.g., every new chemical element
must be named according to the phonology and grammar of particular language,
while figuring out what this new name must be derived from.

Ksinoy avoids all that, deriving its vocabulary directly from the standard
codes, which means that once a standard body encodes a thing, it automatically
gets its name, pronounceable and unambiguous.

There are categories of nouns that form distinct groups, idiomatically named,
and relatively well-defined and standardized.  Examples include

* names of countries (ISO codes: GB, DE, FI, UA, CA, US)
* names of languages (ISO codes: eng, deu, fra, ita, zho)
* names of chemical elements (IUPAC symbols: H, He, N, Co, Fe, Au)
* names of living things (Scientific nomenclature)
* emoji (Unicode)

Some other entities are morhologically regulated stems as well.


### Languages

Names of languages are derived from three letter ISO 639-3 codes.
Example tranfsormations:

 Language | ISO | Transormation steps | Result
---|---|---|---
Afrikaans |_afr_ | afure |  _afúreh_
Chinese | _zho_ |  zhoi | _zahóih_
Italian | _ita_ |  itai | _itáih_
German | _deu_ | deiui | _denúih_
English | _eng_ | esnoga | _esnógah_
Sanskrit | _san_ | sain | _sáisnoh_
Swahili | _swa_ | swai | _supláih_

Formal prefix for language names is _ksi-_.  
* _Ksi-nesnogah i-jan._  
English is difficult.

### Countries

Names of countries are derived from two letter ISO 3166-2 codes.  
Example transformations:

Country | ISO | Result
---|---|---
United Arab Emirates | ae | _anéih_
India | in |  _ísnoh_
Albania | al | _áileh_
Germany | de | _deih_
UK  | gb  | _gábah_
France | fr | _fúreh_
Poland | po | _poih_
USA | us | _úsuh_

Formal category prefix for countries is _ma-_.

* _Rhame ima-gabah._
My home is the United Kingdom.

* _Rhame i-gabah._
My home is "GB" (however this abbreviation may be interpreted by the receipient).

If you leave off prefix _ma-_ <i>and</i> the suffix *-h*, _gaba_ will be interpreted as non-systematic word of stems _ga_ (many) and _ba_ (want).

### Chemical elements

Names of elements are derived from one or two letter symbols for elements, maintained by IUPAC.

Prefix element names is _pu-_, and it may not be omitted.

Element | Symbol | Result
---|---|---
Hydrogen | _H_ | _pu-heh_
Helium | _He_ |  _pu-heih_
Oxygen | _O_ | _pu-oih_
Iron | _Fe_ | _pu-feih_
Arsenic  | _As_  | _pu-aisuh_
Gold | _Au_ | _pu-anuih_
Mercury | _Hg_ | _pu-hegah_
Chromium | _Cr_ | _pu-skereh_

* _Fhido ipu-snoh ha pu-oih._  
Air contains nitrogene and oxygene.

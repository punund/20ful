# Abbreviations

Ksinoy incudes a set of rules to convert abbreviations to pronounceable words. This is an important feature of the language morhology.

An abbreviation is assumed to be any sequence of 26 letters of the alphabet.

The procedure of converting an abbreviation into a Ksinoy word is known as
<i>elongation</i>.  The resulting word may also be called elongation.

Elongations don't comply with regular Ksinoy phonetic and orthographic
restrictions, they may start with a vowel and are stressed differently.

## Marking elongation

Words ending in *h*, and only such words, are elongations.

## Rules of elongation

The rules of elongation are as follows and are applied simultaneously to each
letter:

* if a vowel is followed by another vowel, *n* is inserted (AO.. → *ano..*, EI.. → *eni..*)
* otherwise, *i* is inserted after a vowel, but not after I: (AT.. → *ai*T.., ..MU → ..M*ui*, ..IK.. → *..i*K..)
* consonants are expanded to their names (B → *ba*, T → *tu*, Q → *kfo*, Y →*yo* etc.)
If this results in two vowels in a row, first one is dropped (CE → *sko* + *e..* → *ske..*, PI → *pu* + *i* → *pi*)
* *h* is appended at the end.

## Position of stress

* if there are diphtongs in the resulting word, last one is stressed
* otherwise, penultimate syllable is stressed

::: optional
There may be a secondary stress whereever seen fit by a speaker.

## Example elongation

Stages of transormation for an imaginary abbreviation:

Stage | Result
-|-
Initial word |QRAKEUT
Consonants expanded | *Kfo*-*Re*-A-*Ku*-E-U-*Tu*
Double vowels dropped | Kfo-*R*-A-*K*-E-U-Tu
Vowels expanded | Kfo-R-*Ai*-K-*En*-*Ui*-Tu
*h* appended | Kfo-R-Ai-K-En-Ui-Tu-*h*
The result | *kforáikenuituh*

::: optional
An *n* inserted after an *I* may be omitted: KIA → *kináih* or *kiáih*.
If this leads to *iu* or *io*, *q* is needed to separate syllables:
STIO → *sutínoh* or *sutíqoh*.
:::

::: optional
If "N" to be elongated follows a vowel, or is the first letter, (but not *i*), it may be elongated to *no* instead of its name *fno*:
ANSG → *ai(f)nosúga*, KINA → *kifna* only, WONGR → *plói(f)nogare*
:::

Examples: NATO: *(f)naitóih*, OSEAN: *oisenáinoh*, UNCHR: *úinoskohéreh*, SQI: *súkfih*,
HRV: *herévah*.

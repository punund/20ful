# Predicative identifier

Pronoun *shi* replaces entire predicate of a phrase.  Therefore, only the
subject is needed to complete a sentence with *shi* or its derivate.

*Shi* connects with correlative specifiers:

Interrogative |*kin* | *Sa kinshi?* | What do you do?
Proximal |*ge* | *Han ko-geshi.* | She did it.
Distal |*koi* | *Roman bakoishi.* | No one wants to do that.
Existential |*hai* | *Sa fen-haishi.* | You will be doing something.
Universal |*xo* | *Me puixoshi.* | I want to do everything.
Negatory |*ro* | *Me ko-roshi.* | I did nothing.

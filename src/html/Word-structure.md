A word is built from optional prefixes, one or more roots, and optional suffixes:

	[prefixes "-"] root [root] [root] ... [suffix] [suffix]

Prefixes, if present, are followed by dash: *uxo-ftonda*.

## Suffixes

Suffixes, if present, are single consonants. Some suffixes are:

* -*s* plural in nouns and pronouns
* -*t* accusative case
* -*h* signals an elongation
* -*k* suffix of an adjective


## Roots

Short roots are one syllable long, and long roots are two syllables long.

### Short roots

Short root's structure corresponds to one of two models:

<pre>
	C<sub>1</sub> V <em>i</em>/<em>n</em>
	C<sub>1</sub> C<sub>2</sub> V <em>i</em>/<em>n</em>
</pre>

* C<sub>1</sub> is any consonant, except for _N_ and *Y*.
* No consonant doubling is possible in the root.
Not all consonants and consonant pairs are possible as C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>.

"V" is any vowel. The second vowel _i_, if present, in short root always forms a diphtong.

Valid roots: *po, kei, flan, fto, xyen, li, tii*  
Invalid roots: **ne, nko, yo, yma, rra**

### Long roots

Long root consists of a short root followed by an extra syllable:

<pre>
	[Short root] V [<em>i</em>/<em>n</em>]
</pre>

If short root has a diphtong, it can't be followed by *i*:  
__meii, blaii__ not possible.

Syllable boundary in a long root is right before the second vowel:  
*ka·é, gren·ói, klai·ón, su·án, ren·ín, broi·ái*

The second vowel of a long root is always stressed.

Primary stress falls on the fist root in a word.  Therefore, if the first root is a long root, its second syllable holds the primary stress:  
*suán.tan.re, xkenái.do.dun, oi-foén*

Otherwise, the stress is on the first syllable of the sequence of roots:  
*i-ló.fai.s, ui-kí.dei.ran*

A word usually contains only one long root, which, if present, must come first in the sequence of roots.  If there is another long root in a word, it must be preceded by a dash: _tre·o.kyún-rhaná_.

It is always possible to unambiguously detect all roots and therefore, correct stress, as no root can start with *n* or a vowel:

*mó.ken.ten*  
*monén.ten*  
*moén.ten*  

Dashes separating prefixes are never omitted, but periods, middle dots, and stress marks are here only for clarity, the words above are normally spelled as follows:

*kae, grenoi, klaion, suan, renin, broiai*  
*treokyun-rhana*  
*suantanre, xkenaidodun, i-lofais, ui-kideiran*  
*mokenten, monenten, moenten*  


### Prefixes

A prefix has the same structure as a short root with some rules modified.  It can omit initial consonants: *u-*, *oi-*, *uxo-* are valid prefix groups (*uxo-* is a sequence of two prefixes: _u_ and *xo*), or start with a "N" or bare "Y": *nai-*, *yo-* may exist.

However, double initial consonants are not allowed: **kro-** may not serve as a prefix.

## Tenses

Verbs are conjugated in four tenses. Tenses are marked with prefixes. Tense prefixes must come very first in a sequence of prefixes.

| Tense | Prefix |
|-------|--------|
| indefinite | i-   |
| past       | u-   |
| perfect    | ui-  |
| future     | yo-  |

Indefinite tense may also refer to events in the past or future. Perfect tense roughly corresponds to Present Perfect or Past Perect in English.

Prefix of indefinite tense may be omitted.

*Me i-fu mlet.* I eat (an) apple.  
*Sa ui-fu mlet.* You have eaten (an) apple.  
*Hans yo-fu mlest.* They will eat apples.

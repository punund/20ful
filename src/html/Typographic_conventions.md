## Typography
### Native words

Ksinoy words and letters comprising Ksinoy words appear in this type: *faei*.

### Emphasis

Italicized content bears logical emphasis: this feature is <i>essential</i>.

### Pronunciation

Letters between slahses are to be interpreted as
[IPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Association)
characters: *rhione* is pronounced /<sup>ə</sup>rhœne'/.

### Acute accent

Stressed vowels may be indicated by adding acute accent: *koi-tranói*.  However,
stress position is always unambiguous and normally doesn't need to be marked.

### Incorrect usage

Anything in carmine is an anti-example, wrong usage: **wahen** is
nonexistent, as *w* can't be a part of a word.

### Examples

Usage examples are often given in tables with solid background:

|-|-|
*su* | above
*zi* | below {.example}

### Optional part

In grammar diagrams, things between square brackets indicate elements that
may not be present:

-|-
essential|[optional]

### Variants available

Ksinoy is designed to to let you do things in more than one way. Text on greeny
background appears whenever a language feature lets you choose among variants of
spelling, pronunciation, or morphology.  Whenever variants are marked this way,
they are always equal and there is no preferrable or more "correct" way of
spelling and pronunciation.

::: optional
You may pronounce *iyn* as /ijn/ or as /ejn/.

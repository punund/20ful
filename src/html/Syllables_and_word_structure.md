## Syllables and word structure

### Full syllable

A full syllable consists of onset (start), nucleus, and optional coda (end).

| Syllable section | Component                         | Symbols     |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------- |
| onset            | One or two consonants             | C₁[C₂]      |
| nucleus          | Single vowel, digraph or trigraph | V₁\[V₂\][i] |
| coda             | Consonant “n”                     | [n]         |

Not all consonants may serve as C₁ and C₂. In particular, “j” and “c” can’t be combined with any C2, and “y” may not appear as C, and may not be followed by iu/io.

### Consonant harmony

C₁ and C₂ in a syllable may not be of contrasting voicedness: they must be either both voiced, or both voiceless. A neutral consonant is allowed in any position. *M, L, R, N, Y* are considered neutral.
**fb**-, **zt**-, **sv**-, **vt**- and such are therefore impossible, but *fp*-, *zd*-, *sf*-, *vd*- etc are.

### Two initial consonants

Whenever a word begins with two consonants, an
[epenthetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epenthesis) schwa (short neutral
unstressed vowel) may be prepended:<br> e.g. *rhana* is prononunced as
/<sup>ə</sup>rhaná/.

::: optional
With some combination schwa is used more than with others, but it is always
permissible to insert (or omit) the schwa in front of any two initial consonants.
:::
However, inserting an extra vowel <i>between</i> the consonants is wrong: **/r<sup>ə</sup>hana/**.

### Sample syllables
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Simple vowels                 | *pa, pre, pran, krun, sue, pio, fya*         |
| Core syllables                | *pai, prei, prain, kruain, pioi, pyoi, fyai* {.example}

### Naked syllable

Naked syllable is a full syllable with zero onset, i.e. it always start with a vowel: *i*, *on*, *uei*, *ain* and such.

### Stems

Monosyllabic stems are known as “short”, while bisyllabic are “long”. Short stem consists of a full syllable.

Long stem is a full syllable, followed by a naked syllable.  Second syllable, if present, is always stressed.  Long stems are <i>usually</i> semantically related to short stems, represented by their constituent first syllable: *toi* (sea) → *toion* (ocean).

Therefore, any valid stem is a sequence:

-|-
full syllable | [naked syllable]

Some examples:

-|-
Monosyllabic stems | *ko, pai, treu, sain, puei*
Bisyllabic stems | *koa*, *paiu*, *paqiu*, *ruean*, *saina*, *koqin*, *saqion*, *puun*, *sueqin* {.example}


Syllabization is “greedy” by default: if a letter may belong to the ongoing
syllable, it does do: *sain|a, ko|an, kuan, suen|on,  piu|u.*  Default is
overridden when *q* is used: *kuq|an, piq|u, sueq|in*.

### Full word

Full word is represented by the following sequence:

-|-|-|-
[prefixes-] | full stem | [simple stems] | [suffixes]

One or more prefixes are separated with dash (“-”).

### More on stress position

The second vowel of a long root is always stressed.

Primary stress falls on the fist root in a word. Therefore, if the first root is a long root, its second syllable holds the primary stress:
*suqántanre*, *xkenáidodun*, *oi-foén*

Otherwise, the stress is on the first syllable of the sequence of roots:
*i-lófai*, *ui-kídeiran*

A word usually contains only one long root, which, if present, must come first in the sequence of roots. If there is another long root in a word, it must be preceded by a dash, and may carry a secondary stress: *treókyun-rhaná*.

It is always possible to unambiguously detect all roots and therefore, correct stress, as no root can start with *n* or a vowel:

*mó.ken.ten*, *monén.ten*, *moén.ten*

Dashes separating prefixes or long roots are never omitted.

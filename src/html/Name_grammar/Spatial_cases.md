## Spatial cases

Spatial cases are formed using spatial postfixes.

prefix | meaning
-|-
*su*|above
*zi*|below
*pla*|in front of
*fhi*|behind
*zui*|to the left of
*san*|to the right of
*glu*|inside
*kri*|outside
*do*|at, in, near etc.

### Meaning of *do*

Strictly speaking, *do* is rather locational than spatial. It can be used to
indicate general location almost whereever a spatial prefix can be used:

*rhado* at home, in house \
*ldando* in the country, on land \
*breido* at friend's, in friend's possession

It is always permissible to use *do* in place of any other spatial case.

### Proximity particles

Spatial prefixes may be optionally followed by proximity particles *ge*, *koi*,
*koioi* to indicate distance:

-|-
*ge* | touching the object
*koi* | not touching the object, further away
*koioi* | there is an another object in between

Usage examples:

-|-
*venásuge* | on the table
*venásukoi* | above the table
*venázikoi* | under the table, perhaps on the floor
*venázige* | attached to the inner surface of the table
*venázikoioi* | directly below the table underneath another obstacle, perhaps on a lower storey or in the ground {.example}

However, it is always permissible to not use the proximity particles:
-|-
*venázi* | somewhere underneath the table{.example}

or, for that matter, spatial suffixes:
-|-
*venádo* | on, at, near, beside, or anywhere in general proximity of the table{.example}

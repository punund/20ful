## Alphabet and sounds

Standard Latin alphabet is in use.
Dash “-” is also part of the alphabet.  Sometimes the stress is marked
with acute accent (á, é) across this guide for didactic purposes, however,
the accented letters should not be construed as belonging to the alphabet.

### Alphabet


| Letter | Name | Pronunciation | Approximation | Property  | Numeric value
| ------ | ---- | -------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ---------
| *a* | an | /a/ | cut |  | |

| *e* | en | /ɛ/ | get |  | |
| *f* | fu | /f/ | fun |  voiceless | 4
| *g* | ga | /g/ | game  | voiced | 2
| *h* | he | /h/ | he | neutral | 
| *i* | i | /i/ | inn | | 0
| *j* | tro | /dʒ/ or /tr/ | joy, tree | | 
| *k* | ku | /k/ | kite |  voiceless | 7
| *l* | le | /l/ | lot | neutral | 1

Notes


- *q* is a glottal stop, breaking syllables that would otherwise be diphtongs
- *y* is always a consonant
- *w* is not used in native words
- *j* and *c* in front of labial vowels *iu*, *io* are always realized as /tr/ and /sk/ respectively
- letter names are meaningful and play important role in forming certain classes of words

::: optional
*j* and *c* may also be realized as /tr/ and /sk/ in other positions.

### Basic digraphs

There are five basic digraphs: *ue*, *ua*, *io*, *iu*, *iy*. Morphologically, they are considered simple vowels, alongside with five alphabetic vowels, but phonetically, *ue*/*ua* are diphtongs, while *io*/*iu* form front rounded vowels:

| Digraph | Pronunciation |
| ------- | ------------------------- |
| *ue* | /we/ as in “swell” |
| *ua* | /wa/ as in “one” |
| *io* | /œ/ as in “girl” |
| *iu* | /y/ as in “über” (German) |
| *iy* | /iʝ/ or /ih/ or /ix/ |

::: optional
Pronunciation of *iy* may vary depending on its position and speaker's preference.
Also, *iyn* may be prononunced /ejn/.
:::


### Vowel gradation

All vowels are understood to be paired with a corresponding digraph, which plays a morphological role:

Vowel | Digraph | Examples
-|-|-
e | ue | *kye* sun → *kyue* sunny
a | ua | *gai* dig → *guai* digging
o | io | *toi* sea → *tioi* marine, of the sea
u | iu | *bu* mouth → *biu* oral, by mouth
i | iy | *xi* know → *xiy* knowing

More on that in the Morphology section.


### Glottal stop

Glottal stop is found between two vowels of different syllables. *Q* is used to contrast diphthongs to bisyllabic words:

Word  | is... | Sounds like
-|-|-
*koin* | diphtong | English "coin"
*koqín* | bisyllabic | close to "ko_in"

 No *q* is used where no ambiguity exists: *kuun* or *pkii* or *staon* can’t be mistaken for diphthongs and require no *q*. The glottal stop is produced nevertheless: /ku’un/ etc.

### Vowel combinations

Any simple vowel, except “i”, may be followed by i, forming core digrahps and trigraphs:

| Core combinations | Component | Approximation in English |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Core digraphs | *ai*, *ei*, *oi*, *ui*, *iy* | pie, may, toy, tuya |
| Core trigraphs | *uei*, *uai*, *iui*, *ioi* | sway, Kwai, …, … |
{.example}

Trigraph __iyi__ doesn’t exist.

### Iotized sounds

Morphologically *y* is a consonant. Note that *syo* and *sio* (somewhat close to English “sir”) are different, the latter being single vowel.  Besides, *y* is always valid part of onset: *kya* is a syllable, while *kia* is interpreted as *ki|a*, as digraph “ia” doesn’t exist.

However, *kiu* is a diphtong, and *kyu*, *kiu*, *kiqu*, *kiiu* etc. are all valid and distinct:

| Word | Syllables | Pronunciation
| ---- | --------- | -------------
| *kyu*   | 1         | /kju/
| *kui*   | 1         | /kuj/
| *kiu*   | 1         | /ky/
| *kiui*  | 1         | /kyj/
| *kiqú*  | 2         | /ki’u/
| *kiyú*  | 2         | /kij’u/
| *kiiú*  | 2         | /ki’y/
| *kiuú*  | 2         | /ky’u/
| *kiuiú*| 2         | /kyj'u/
| *kiuqiú*| 2         | /ky'y/
| *kyui*  | 1         | /kjuj/
| *kyuqiú* | 2         | /kju'y/ {.example}

(Keep in mind that ksinoy's *y* and IPA's /y/ are different sounds: *y*: /j/, *iu*: /y/)

In reality, the language is not that abusive with many similarly looking and
sounding words, but it is important to know that syllabization and pronunciation are unambiguous at all times.
